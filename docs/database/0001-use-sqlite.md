# {Decision to use SQLite}

## Context and Problem Statement

{We need a database system to use in our project for the library management system. We need a system we are all competent and comfortable using as well as something that is suitable for the website}

## Decision Drivers

* {Experience}
* {Suitability}

## Considered Options

* {SQLite}
* {MYSQL}
* {php}

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "{SQLite}", because {it is the database we are most experienced in using and since this is only a mock website it doesn't need to be scaled, in reality we would use MYSQL}.

### Consequences

* Good, because {Easier to use}
* Bad, because {Not scalable, not industry standard}
