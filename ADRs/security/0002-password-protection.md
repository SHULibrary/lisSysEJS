# {Decision to use password rules}

## Context and Problem Statement

{Same as before however the time constraints due to changing the database has inhibited our development time}

## Decision Drivers

* {Abiding by laws}
* {Suitability}
* {Experience}
* {Complexity}

## Considered Options

* {Hashing + Password Rules}
* {Hashing}
* {Password Rules}
* {None}

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "{Password Rules}", because {it makes users passwords stronger}.

### Consequences

* Good, because {Still provides a level of protection}
* Bad, because {Not as secure as hashing}

## More Information

{Had to change to this from hashing because of time constraints. In a real world scenario we would also include hashing}
